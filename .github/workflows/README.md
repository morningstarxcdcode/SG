- **Backend performance analysis** with API testing
- **Database performance testing** with MongoDB
- **Mobile bundle analysis** and optimization
- **Load and stress testing** with realistic scenarios
- **Memory usage analysis** and optimization
- **Performance regression detection**

### 6. üöÄ Release & Deployment (`release-deployment.yml`)
**Triggers**: Version tags, manual release dispatch
- **Automated version management** with semantic versioning
- **Changelog generation** with categorized commits
- **Multi-platform Docker builds** with security scanning
- **Staging deployment** with smoke tests
- **Production deployment** with health checks
- **GitHub release creation** with assets

## üîß Setup Requirements

### Required Secrets
Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Security Scanning
SNYK_TOKEN=your_snyk_token
SONAR_TOKEN=your_sonarcloud_token

# Container Registry
GITHUB_TOKEN=automatic_github_token

# Mobile Deployment (optional)
EXPO_TOKEN=your_expo_token

# Notifications (optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK=your_slack_webhook
DISCORD_WEBHOOK=your_discord_webhook
```

### Required Environments
Create these environments in your repository settings:
- `staging` - For staging deployments
- `production` - For production deployments (with protection rules)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Fork or clone** the SecureGuardian repository
2. **Add required secrets** to your repository settings
3. **Create environments** (staging, production)
4. **Push changes** to trigger workflows
5. **Monitor** workflow execution in Actions tab

## üìö Workflow Customization

### Modifying Workflows
Each workflow is designed to be modular and customizable:

- **Environment variables**: Modify in workflow files
- **Testing frameworks**: Update in respective job steps
- **Deployment targets**: Configure in deployment jobs
- **Security tools**: Add/remove in security jobs

### Adding New Components
To add new components to the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Create component-specific jobs
2. Add to dependency matrix
3. Include in testing strategy
4. Update security scanning scope

## üÜò Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
